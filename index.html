        <h2>The story </h2>

        <blockquote>

            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a
                <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/292028398/Chinese-farmer" target="_blank" title="In case you need to relate on Reddit">Chinese farmer</a> whose horse ran away.</br>
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em>"Maybe"</em>. The next day the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3rpmctmC_M"
                    target="_blank" title="Look at my horse, my horse is amazing">horse</a> came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <em>"Maybe"</em>. The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
                leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <span class="neg">bad</span>,</q> and the farmer responded, <em>"Maybe"</em>. The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected
                his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <em>"Maybe"</em>. The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible
                to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="pos">good</span> or <span class="neg">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
                <span
                    class="pos">good</span> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <blockquote> <span class="pos">good</span> and <span class="neg">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="pos">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="pos">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
